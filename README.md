## 🌟 Overview
This project combines **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with a **neural network coded from scratch** to predict **energy consumption** based on datetime features.  

Instead of using deep learning frameworks, everything is implemented in **pure Python + NumPy** to understand the nuts and bolts of:
- Forward pass  
- Backpropagation  
- Loss minimization  
- Training loops  

---

## 🔥 Features
- ✅ Clean **EDA pipeline** with feature engineering from datetime  
- ✅ **Hand-crafted ANN** implementation (no black boxes!)  
- ✅ Training loop with loss reduction visualization  
- ✅ Energy prediction results on processed dataset  
- ✅ Well-commented code for easy learning & reproducibility
